Hi! My name is Priyankari (Priya) Perali. I am a masters student in computer science at Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. Robin Murphy. My research interests are broadly in human-centered AI/ML, robust machine learning, and human-robot interaction. I am passionate about societal applications like disaster response and recovery, humanitarian, and sustainable applications.

My master's research is in Human-Robot Interaction, specifically investigating the role of touch interaction between trapped victims in rubble and small unmanned ground vehicles (sUGVs). Besides my thesis work, I work in curating disaster datasets of aerial imagery and developing robust machine learning/computer vision models for damage assessments, funded by the [AI Institute for Societal Decision Making](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-sdm/). [Check out the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset, if interested!](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CRASAR/CRASAR-U-DROIDs). 

Previously, I graduated from The Ohio State University for my bachelors, majoring in computer science and engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. At Ohio State, I was a part of the Humanitarian Engineering Scholars program, where I worked on designing engineering solutions for marginalized and underserved communities.
